    This module is structured around a series of practical code examples, demonstrating on real world problems. PIAIC strongly believes in the value of teaching using concrete examples, anchoring theoretical ideas into actual results and tangible code patterns. These examples all rely on Keras, the Python deep learning library.
     Students will learn Deep Learning for computer vision, text and sequences, finance, and advanced neural network design.`,
